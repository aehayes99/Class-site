      <h2><em>by William Blake (1757-1827)</em></h2>

      <p><big>Tiger Tiger, burning bright,<br>
In the forests of the night;<br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?</big><br>
<br>
<small>In what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?<br>

<br>
And what shoulder, and what art,<br>
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
And when thy heart began to beat,<br>
What dread hand? and what dread feet?</p><br>
<br>
<div class="container1"><img src="tiger 3.png"></div>
<div class="float"><p><small>What the hammer? what the chain,<br>
In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
What the anvil? what dread grasp,<br>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!<br>
<br>
When the stars threw down their spears<br>
And water’d heaven with their tears:<br>
Did he smile his work to see?<br>
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?<br>
<br>
Tiger Tiger burning bright,<br>
In the forests of the night:<br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?<br></small></p></div></div>

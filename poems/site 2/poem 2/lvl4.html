     <em><h3>by William Blake (1757-1827)</h3></em>





 <div2><p><strong>Tiger Tiger, burning bright,</strong><br>
In the forests of the night;<br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

In what distant deeps or skies.
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?<br>
On what wings dare he aspire?
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
<br>
<br>

And what shoulder, and what art,<br>
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br>
And when thy heart began to beat,<br>
What dread hand? and what dread feet?<br>
<br>
<br>

What the hammer? what the chain,<br>
In what furnace was thy brain?<br>
What the anvil? what dread grasp,<br>
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!<br>
<br>
<br>

When the stars threw down their spears
And water’d heaven with their tears:<br>
Did he smile his work to see?
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Tiger Tiger burning bright,</strong><br>
In the forests of the night:<br>
What immortal hand or eye,<br>
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?<br></div2></p>
